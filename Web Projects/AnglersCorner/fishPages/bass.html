    <p>
      The Small mouth bass is one of the most common fish one will find in North
      American rivers and Ponds. Native to north america,this fish is famous for it's superb
      action and fighting capabilities, sporting a very muscly build which they use for hunting other small fish.

    <h2 class="contentHeader"> Small-mouth Bass </h2>
    <p>
      More common in warmer climates such as southern ontario and the united states, the small-mouth
      is identifiable from it's aptly named brother, the large mouth. As seen in the picture to the right,
      the small-mouth has exactly that, a small pointed mouth which is used for darting around catching smaller
      fish and worms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the fact that the small-mouth feeds on worms and lives in a warmer climate where bacteria and parasites grow much easier,
      the small-mouth is not typically eaten, or at least is not served at seafood restaurants. The fish is still edible, however,
      should one be camping and in need of dinner.

    <h2 class="contentHeader"> Large-mouth Bass </h2>

    <p>
      The Large mouth Bass is known for its large bucket shaped mouth. The large-mouth is just as fast and furious as the small-smallmouth,
      however, it's bucket shaped mouth creates a vaccuum when opening very quickly, which helps suck in larger fish than the smallmouth may be
      capable of. While not dangerous to humans, these fish are known to be quite greedy, adn will often attempt to eat things larger than them.
      They also may tend to hit a lure or bait simply out of irritation, regardless if they are hungry or not.
