    <p>
      The walleye gets its name due to its exceptionally large eyes. The walleye, along with its eyes, have large fins
      and a sharp needly spine which acts as a defense mechanism to ward off prey. Typically, found in rivers and stream,
      often in deeper channel where the water is cooler and darker, the walleye likes to feed on fish slighly smaller than itself.
    </p>

    <h2 class="contentHeader"> Feeding Habits </h2>
    <p>
      The walleye, as mentioned before, typically hangs out in deep channels which fisherman call, "holes".
      These places are formed by erosion in the river or lake bed, and create a perfect hideout for hunting.
      Due to the Walleye's expetionally large eyes, they take in a lot of light making them capable of seeing
      in darker conditions than their prey. Also, due to the fact that their eyes are on the top of their
      head, they swim low and ambush their prey above.

    <h2 class="contentHeader"> Common Lures </h2>

    <p>
      Since Walleye commonly feed on Yellow Perch and other small fish like minnows, many will recommend
      flourescent top lures or divers meant to resemble a perch. The only issues one might find when
      using this tactic is that simply, everybody is using this tactic, thus odd alternatives often produce
      better results, particularly in highly trafficked areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      From personal experience, a very tried and true lure for Pickerel in Southern/Northern Ontario are White Jig-heads
      with a red eye. Pair these with white rubber tails and they quickly resemble the shape of a small minnow flashing
      at the surface or a leech. Due to their smaller size but similar attraction to that of lures that imitate a
      Perch, they tend to produce significant results. Similarly, if fishing in rivers with Bass and Pike, this
      lure will also produce great results on those other species, so for fishing in general, this lure is a
      secret pick. Plus, jig fishing is fun and this lure can even be cast and reeled!
