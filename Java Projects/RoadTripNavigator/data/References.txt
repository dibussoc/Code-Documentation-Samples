Princeton Library (same one used in labs: edu.princeton.cs.algs4):
Many classes from the princeton library were utilized in the implementation of these Algorithms.
Such classes include: In, Bag, Stack, IndexMinPQ.
Part's of Princeton's standard Dijkstra's Algorithm for graphs of integers from the algs4.jar and Algorithms textbook 
was used as a basis for the modified custom version implemented in this assignment.
Princeton's EdgeWeightedGraph was also used to form an idea of how to make my VertexWeightedGraph, although only a few of the methods were useful
as reference for my implementation.
Princeton's DirectedEdges was referenced simply to see what the state variables should look like.

In class Labs material:
The basic DFS and BFS for integers that we implemented in lab was used as a basis and modified to produce the custom
version needed and used in this assignment.
Also the Graph.java we made in lab was used slightly as reference for the Graph.java implementation in this assignment.
