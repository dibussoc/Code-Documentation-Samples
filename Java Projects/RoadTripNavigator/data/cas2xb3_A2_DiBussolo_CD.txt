Design Decisions:
	My design decisions and algorithmic reasoning was thoroughly explained in data/a2_answers.txt so I won't
bother explaining that here. Some side notes, many extra methods were added to the standard DFS/BFS/Dijkstra/Graphs
formula we covered in class for ease of access in this assignment. Such methods include various accessor
methods mainly for checking validity of vertices/edges as well as accessor for many custom state variables
I chose to use in my design. Many methods were also implemented simply for modularity in testing so my main
functions were not cluttered. I was also not sure if we had to run part(3.4) through a junit, so I chose
to keep the testing and outputs in the main() function of VertexWeightedDigraph.java. Similarly, the 
method of running and testing my DFS and BFS in the junit can originally be found in the main function of
Graph.java. 

Overall, in order to run everything done in this assignment the following files should be run:
 VertexWeightedDigraph.java, DepthFirstSearchTest.java, BreadthFirstSearchTest.java. 

	For a list of everything I used references for when producing and designing my solution to this assignment
see data/References.txt. For the IEEE of works cited (literally just the textbook), see data/WorksCited.txt.
For my analysis of the problem and my design decisions, see data/a2_answers.txt. Have a nice day.
