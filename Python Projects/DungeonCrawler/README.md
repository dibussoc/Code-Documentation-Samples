My contributions included Everything from initial Requirements Analysis and Architectural design to coding and testing, as well as contribution to all documentation. In particular I mostly coded the Enemy Module however I contributed to every module to some degree as it was a rather small team of only 5 people.

Unfortunately all the documentation was stored seperately in a school Gitlab repository used for submission that I no longer have access to. The code you see here was pulled from my old school laptop I was able to retrieve.
