Contributions:
We did not actually write much of the game code ourselves, as the purpose of the project was mostly refactoring and improving upon the existing code, as outlined in the README of the previous directory. My personal contributions included contributing to the refactoring and reorganizing of code, module design, leading team discussions, contributing to the accompanying engineering documentation as well as leading team presentations to clients (Professors and Master's students in this case).
