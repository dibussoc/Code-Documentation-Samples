# GOOGLE IT AUTOMATION WITH PYTHON
-----------------------------------------------------
There were 6 courses in total in this course, however the labs for 3 of them were contained solely in the VM I did the work on for lab evaluation.
Only the remaining 3 courses had code that I wrote on my own PC as part of longer project labs.

C2_PythonAndOS
The second course in the specialization focused on IT operations and working with the operating system through Python using APIs from various python libraries. These included libraries such as Regex, OS, psutil, etc. The course also focused on scripting and automating common IT tasks such as parsing and operating on common file types like CSV files, as well as automating log generation.

C4_TroubleshootingDebugging
As the name implies this focused on troubleshooting programs, breaking programs down into components to solve larger problems, optimizing code using profiling and debugging tools.

C6_RealWorldTasksPython
This course put most of the knowledge from other courses into one lab based course, focusing on performing common real world tasks using the skills learned. Such tasks included iterating through file systems and performing tasks like altering a directory of images using the Pillow Python library, partsing through text and CSV files to get product descriptions, formatting said data into auto generated reports in PDF format, as well as automatically sending said reports using auto-generated emails in Python. The course wrapped up by creating some performance monitoring for VM's and sending automated email notifications to IT personnel as alerts when VM health was compromised.

Examples of these topics can be seen in the programs in their respective directories.
